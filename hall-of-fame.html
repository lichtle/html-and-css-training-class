          <p>
            He arrived at Flamengo with the arduous mission of replacing the
            idol Leônidas da Silva. Despite the skepticism, he quickly showed
            his worth and became one of the attacking references of the Rio de
            Janeiro club. To this day, he is the highest scorer in one edition
            of the state championship, having scored 39 goals in 1941.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            The blond angel of Gávea never hid his identification with Flamengo.
            Dressed in red and black, he was part of the squads that won the
            Brasileirão in 1992 and the Carioca championship in 1996.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Romário (1995 to 1997 and 1998 to 1999)</h3>
          <img
            src="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F0730%2Fr577114_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"
            alt="Picture of Romário"
          />
          <p>
            Elected the best player in the world after Brazil's victory in the
            1994 World Cup, Romário left Barcelona for Flamengo. Despite the
            hype, the 'Baixinho' (Shorty) only won his first title in 1996.
            Throughout the years defending the Rubro-Negro, Romário scored 204
            goals.

          <h3>Rondinelli (1971 to 1981)</h3>

            alt="Picture of Rondinelli"
          />
          <p>
            Known by the fans as the "Deus da Raça" (<em
              >God of Determination</em
            >), he was the hero of the 1978 state title when he scored an
            unforgettable header goal against Vasco.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Evaristo de Macedo (1953 to 1957 and 1965 to 1967)</h3>
          <img

            alt="Picture of Evaristo de Macedo"
          />
          <p>
            Idolized both at Barcelona and Real Madrid, Evaristo de Macedo is
            regarded as one of the great players of his generation. At Flamengo,
            he won the state championships in 1953, 1954, 1955, and 1965. He
            also managed the club on three occasions as the head coach of the
            first team.

          <h3>Nunes (1980 to 1984)</h3>

            alt="Picture of Nunes"
          />
          <p>
            After playing for several clubs, Nunes, also known as João Danado,
            became the 'Decisive Scorer' wearing the Flamengo jersey, where he
            was one of the heroes of the Intercontinental Cup in 1981.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bruno Henrique (2019 - today)</h3>

            alt="Picture of Bruno Henrique"
          />
          <p>
            With his speed and leaping ability that brings a smile to every
            Flamengo fan's face, Bruno Henrique has secured his place in history
            as one of the top scorers of Flamengo in the 21st century. He has
            been a crucial player in titles such as the 2019 Libertadores and
            the 2019 and 2020 Brasileirão championships, among other trophies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Everton Ribeiro (2017 - today)</h3>
          <img
            src="https://lncimg.lance.com.br/cdn-cgi/image/width=3840,height=undefined,quality=75/uploads/2023/05/6428d9eb1ab7d-aspect-ratio-512-320.jpeg"
            alt="Picture of Everton Ribeiro"
          />
          <p>
            A midfielder with great skill, Everton Ribeiro scored stunning goals
            and won important titles representing one of the most remarkable
            generations in Flamengo's history.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Dida (1954 to 1963)</h3>
          <img
            src="https://terceirotempo.uol.com.br/imagens/19/98/w500_h140_qfl_fto_11998.webp"
            alt="Picture of Dida"
          />
          <p>
            Dida was Zico's greatest idol. The 'Little Rooster from Quintino'
            never hid his admiration for the striker, which is why he did
            everything to play for Flamengo. Despite his slender build, Dida
            became the club's top scorer until the Zico era, scoring 257 goals
            in 364 matches between 1954 and 1963.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Adriano (2000 to 2001, 2009 to 2010 and 2012)</h3>
          <img
            src="https://lncimg.lance.com.br/cdn-cgi/image/width=3840,height=undefined,quality=75/uploads/2016/10/07/57f803c9bfffa.jpeg"
            alt="Picture of Adriano"
          />
          <p>
            The Emperor was always regarded as one of the main prospects in
            Flamengo's youth categories. However, when he reached the
            professional level, he wasn't properly utilized and soon left the
            club. Nonetheless, he returned to Gávea, where he became the hero of
            the 2009 Brasileirão triumph.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Petkovic (2000 to 2002 and 2009 to 2011)</h3>
          <img
            src="https://static-wp-tor15-prd.torcedores.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Petkovic.jpg"
            alt="Picture of Petkovic"
          />
          <p>
            Pet, as he is also known, entered Flamengo's history initially with
            the free-kick goal that secured the 2001 state title against Vasco.
            After a turbulent departure, the Serbian accepted to return as a way
            to settle a debt the club had with him, despite much skepticism.
            Contrary to what many believed, he became a key piece in the 2009
            national title.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Andrade (1979 to 1988)</h3>
          <img
            src="https://terceirotempo.uol.com.br/imagens/46/56/w362_h500_arq_154656.webp"
            alt="Picture of Andrade"
          />
          <p>
            One of the greatest champions in Flamengo's history, Andrade was
            part of four Brasileirão victories with the Rubro-Negro (1980, 1982,
            1983, and 1987), and also played a role in the team's triumph in the
            Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup. As if that wasn't enough, he
            was also one of the main contributors to the 2009 Brazilian title,
            when he took charge of a discredited squad and led them as a coach.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Adílio (1975 to 1987)</h3>

            alt="Picture of Adílio"
          />
          <p>
            Considered one of the most skillful players of his generation,
            Adílio shone in the triumphs of the Copa Libertadores and the Club
            World Cup alongside Zico, Andrade, and Júnior.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Leônidas da Silva (1936 to 1941)</h3>

            alt="Picture of Leônidas da Silva"
          />
          <p>
            Regarded as the best player of the 1938 World Cup, the 'Black
            Diamond' is considered one of the first great idols of Brazilian
            football. With Flamengo, he won the 1939 Carioca championship.
          </p>

            alt="Picture of Zizinho"
          />
          <p>
            With Zizinho, Flamengo won its first three consecutive state
            championships between 1942, 1943, and 1944. This was in addition to
            the Carioca Championship of 1939. Zizinho left Flamengo with 329
            games and 146 goals, and he is considered the greatest idol of the
            club until the emergence of Zico.

            Libertadores and the Club World Cup, in addition to the Brazilian

            The great partner of Zico in Flamengo's greatest triumphs in
            history. Despite being right-footed, he established himself as a
            left-back in the Brazilian national team in 1982. After a relatively
            unremarkable spell in Italy, he returned to the Rio de Janeiro club
            to become the team's leader as a midfielder. Throughout his career,
            he wore the red and black jersey in 865 matches, becoming the player
            who represented Flamengo the most times.

            Known as the "God of Gávea," Zico is a unanimous figure among
            Flamengo supporters. As the main driving force behind the Copa
            Libertadores and Intercontinental Club titles in 1981, he has
            garnered a legion of fans who idolize him to this day.
